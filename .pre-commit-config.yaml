# Pre-commit configuration for Kagent - Enhanced Development Security Features
# This configuration includes ONLY enhanced security and development quality hooks.
# CI-mirror hooks (Go, Python, JavaScript, Helm linting) have been removed to avoid
# duplication with existing CI workflows. These hooks focus on security, commit quality,
# and enhanced development practices.
